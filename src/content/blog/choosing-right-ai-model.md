In today's fast-evolving AI landscape, selecting the right model isn't just a tech decision — it's a strategic advantage. Here's a quick guide to make the right choice:

**LLMs (Large Language Models)** – Ideal for apps needing natural language understanding, content generation, or complex conversations.
- Great choices: GPT-4 (ChatGPT), Claude, Gemini

**Open-Source Models** – Perfect for customization, cost control, or on-prem deployment.
- Consider: Mistral, LLaMA, Mixtral

**Fine-Tuned Models** – When accuracy and domain-specific knowledge are critical (e.g. legal, medical).
- Combine with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for best results.
