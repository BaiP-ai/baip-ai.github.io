In today’s fast-evolving AI landscape, selecting the right model isn't just a tech decision — it’s a strategic advantage. Here’s a quick guide to make the right choice:

🔹 LLMs (Large Language Models) – Ideal for apps needing natural language understanding, content generation, or complex conversations.<br />
 - 𝐆𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭 𝐜𝐡𝐨𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬: GPT-4 (ChatGPT), Claude, Gemini<br />

🔹 Open-Source Models – Perfect for customization, cost control, or on-prem deployment.<br />
 -  𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐫: Mistral, LLaMA, Mixtral<br />

🔹 Fine-Tuned Models – When accuracy and domain-specific knowledge are critical (e.g. legal, medical).<br />
 - 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐛𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐑𝐀𝐆 (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for best results.<br />

🔹 Small Models (Edge AI) – Lightweight and fast for mobile or embedded systems.<br />
 - 𝐓𝐫𝐲: TinyML, DistilBERT, MobileBERT<br />

🎯 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐓𝐢𝐩: Start with your use case, not the model. Define the problem, then find the fit!
