# Blog Images

This directory contains images used in blog posts. 

## Structure

- Place hero images for blog posts in this directory
- Use descriptive filenames that match the blog post topic
- Recommended image formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
- Recommended dimensions: 1200x630 for hero images (social media friendly)

## Image Naming Convention

- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Include relevant keywords
- Example: `responsible-ai-principles.jpg`, `enterprise-ai-trends.jpg`

## Current Placeholder Images

The following images are referenced in the current blog posts but need to be added:

- welcome-hero.jpg
- responsible-ai.jpg  
- enterprise-ai-trends.jpg
- smb-ai-checklist.jpg
- next-leap-ai-reasoning.jpg (NEW - see description file)

These can be replaced with actual images relevant to each blog post topic. A detailed description for the "Next Leap in AI" hero image has been provided in `next-leap-ai-reasoning-description.md`.
